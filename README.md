# DeepLearning

The data set used here is downloaded from UCI machine learning repository. 
link is http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gas+sensors+for+home+activity+monitoring 

The tool I was using is:
Python2+Keras+Theano (2016)

Flow:

1. Data parsing
2. Data preprocessing
3. Data shuffling 
4. One hot coding for multi-label classification
5. Model creating
6. Model compiling
7. Model training (80% of original data)
8. Model evaluating (20% of original data)

Data set comes from UCI machine learning data.

Training accuracy: 95.43%

Test accuracy: 96%

Now it is 2017, Python3+PyTorch will be the mainstream.
